In 574, an emperor of the Northern Zhou dynasty (557\u201381) prohibited Buddhism in China, and many idols were desecrated. This may be the reason the base has some apparently intentional damage (two of four lions have been removed) and is no longer with its original sculpture.

Here, Copley adapted his composition from a mezzotint after William Hogarth's painting of Frances, Lady Byron.\r\n\r\nJohn Singleton Copley was the first great internationally renowned American painter. This work belongs to his most prolific period between 1762 and 1770, and coincides with the emergence of revolutionary ideas in Boston. Largely self-taught, he was the first full-time painter in the colonies. Excelling at capturing texture and surface details, Copley was also known for his uncompromising realism, giving the same meticulous attention to both psychological and formal details.

The imagery on this particularly finely carved example hints at the complex, multi-layered symbolism and religious beliefs embodied by the ballgame. At the closed end of the yoke is a human face peering out through the jaws of a supernatural creature that combines reptile, amphibian, and feline characteristics and lives at the entrance to the underworld.

The artist's modulation of color intensity and placement of horizontal and vertical brushstrokes evoke a woven surface effect that firmly places this painting in what is known as Kirchner's \"tapestry\" period.","title":"Modern Bohemia","marks":null},"1272":{"folder":1,"accession_number":"55.38","art_champions_text":null,"artist":"Artist: Georges Seurat","catalogue_raissonne":null,"classification":" Paintings","continent":"Europe","country":"France","creditline":"The William Hood Dunwoody Fund","culture":null,"curator_approved":0.0,"dated":"1888","department":"Paintings","description":"Pointillism.

He painted six views of the seaport and its surrounding countryside. His intention was \"to translate as exactly as possible the luminosity of the open air, with all its nuances.\" Although Seurat shared the Impressionists' goal of translating nature's light and color, he also wished to make Impressionism more precise. He wanted to replace its spontaneous, improvisational qualities with a more systematic, objective approach that could reflect the essential structures of a landscape, not just its transitory effects. To this end, Seurat developed an unusual new technique, variously called pointillism, divisionism, or Neo-Impressionism. He juxtaposed small dots of pigment according to his interpretation of scientific theories of color and optics. His followers, like Paul Signac, continued the pointillist style after Seurat's early death from pneumonia.","title":"Port-en-Bessin","marks":null},"1274":{"folder":1,"accession_number":"55.39","art_champions_text":null,"artist":"Artist: Constantin Brancusi","catalogue_raissonne":null,"classification":" Sculpture","continent":"Europe","country":"Romania","creditline":"The John R.

Golden Bird belongs to a series of twenty-eight marbles and bronzes exploring the theme of birds and their flight, which Brancusi executed between 1910 and the early 1950s. His inspiration for these sculptures was a Romanian folktale about a dazzling golden bird called the Maiastra, whose magical song restored sight to the blind and youth to the aged.

However, he made a surprising and brilliant detour into abstraction during the 1950s. Long attracted to European painting of the 16th - 17th centuries, it was during a visit to Italy in the late 1940s that he immersed himself in the painterly work of the Baroque period. Studying its celebration of color, gesture, and movement, Guston felt that he could finally reconcile his interest in recognizable form with his impulse toward pure expression.  \r\n\r\nAlthough we don't know for sure if Guston studied the paintings of Peter Paul Rubens, such as the one installed on the opposite wall, he most likely saw the European master's work while traveling in Europe.

As we see here, he developed his own style, with silvery, diffuse light and transparent shadows. And he was a leader of the Utrecht fashion for depicting gamblers playing cards, dice, and backgammon.","title":"The Gamblers","marks":null},"1385":{"folder":1,"accession_number":"60.33","art_champions_text":null,"artist":"Artist: George Bellows","catalogue_raissonne":null,"classification":" Paintings","continent":"North America","country":"United States","creditline":"The Ethel Morrison Van Derlip Fund","culture":null,"curator_approved":0.0,"dated":"1920","department":"Paintings","description":"Portrait.

Of the dozens of extant paintings by Sesson, a Zen priest himself, none so clearly attests to his admiration for Muqi as this misty, moonlit scene of herons cavorting around a gnarled old plum tree and willow. Using the so-called \u201cboneless\u201d technique for which Muqi was famous, Sesson avoided contour lines, relying instead on soft washes of ink. He also borrowed several motifs directly from paintings by Muqi.

Yet he produced grand, inspiring religious paintings.\r\n\r\nThe Immaculate Conception refers to the Catholic doctrine that the Virgin Mary, mother of Christ, was herself born without sin. Following traditional iconography, Castiglione depicted her as Queen of Heaven, accompanied by angels and standing on a crescent moon, a symbol of chastity. The doctrine, much debated, was supported by the Franciscan order of monks. Hence, the presence of two Franciscan saints\u2014Francis of Assisi on the left and Anthony of Padua on the right.\r\n\r\nOne of the few documented paintings in Castiglione\u2019s career, the work was executed for the high altar of the new Capuchin church in Osimo, a small town in central Italy. The bishop of Osimo, Cardinal Girolamo Verospi, arranged the commission in Rome at the expense of Pier Filippo Fiorenzi, archdeacon of the church, whose family coat of arms appears at lower left. The painting was completed in October 1650 just weeks before the artist and his brother mysteriously fled Rome, leaving without their belongings, even, according to records, their underwear.","title":"The Immaculate Conception with Saints Francis of Assisi and Anthony of Padua","marks":null},"1617":{"folder":1,"accession_number":"66.44","art_champions_text":null,"artist":null,"catalogue_raissonne":null,"classification":" Sculpture","continent":"Europe","country":"Italy","creditline":"The Christina N. and Swan J.

In Paris, he helped introduce French artists to the Baroque style: high drama, rich color, intense light, and dark shadows. \/\/\/ We are grateful to Sebastian Sch\u00fctze for clarifying the provenance of this painting.","title":"Angels with Attributes of the Passion: Angel Holding the Vessel and Towel for Washing the Hands of Pontius Pilate","marks":null},"1735":{"folder":1,"accession_number":"69.37","art_champions_text":null,"artist":"Artist: Giovanni Battista Gaulli (Baciccio)","catalogue_raissonne":null,"classification":" Paintings","continent":"Europe","country":"Italy","creditline":"The Frances E.

The home that Wright designed for the Littles was one of his last great Prairie School houses. Characteristically long and low, with a hipped roof, the house featured windows spanning the entire lakeside elevation, giving the Littles full advantage of the impressive view.  Although Wright drew elaborate designs for these windows, Mr. Little did not want an intricate pattern to obscure his view of the lake. As a compromise, large expanses of glass throughout the house have a central area of plain glass \"framed\" with an intricate border. In this hallway, the framed area becomes increasingly complex in the design of the three right windows facing a grove of trees.\r\n\r\nBy the late 1960s the large size of the house, rising property taxes, inflexible built-in furnishings, inadequate insulation, and many uninvited visitors placed the owners, at that time the Littles' daughter and her husband, in a difficult situation. They made every effort to find a purchaser, but no local buyer or institution could be found to save the house on the site. A group of Wright enthusiasts contacted officials at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to see if they might be able to purchase it for installation. The Metropolitan bought only the house in 1972, allowing the current owners to retain the property. Portions of the interior were dismantled for future installation in the Metropolitan and for sale to other institutions. The Minneapolis Institute of Arts purchased this hallway, which led to the master bedroom of the house. It has been installed without its fourth wall of closets, allowing a broader view of the windows.  A model of the house is located directly across from the hallway.","title":"Frank Lloyd Wright Hallway","marks":null},"2031":{"folder":2,"accession_number":"74.2","art_champions_text":null,"artist":"Artist: Luis Trist\u00e1n","catalogue_raissonne":null,"classification":" Paintings","continent":"Europe","country":"Spain","creditline":"The William Hood Dunwoody Fund","culture":null,"curator_approved":0.0,"dated":"1613","department":"Paintings","description":null,"dimension":"56 x 43 in.

The faceless soldier represents all of the people who served their country. The warrior figures carry shields with the insignia of airborne units that flew in Vietnam.  The buffalo (the giver of life), bald eagle (America), golden eagle (the Native American), and bear (bravery and courage) shown across the center are typical animal imagery used in Plains Indian art. \r\n\r\nAs far back as Lakota history tells us, Martin Red Bear says, we as Lakota people have always honored our warriors.  Like all American tribes we still pay a special respect to our soldiers.  In this painting honor is given to all who served during the Vietnam era.

It was based on a 13th-century portrait-sculpture now in the collection of T\u014dsh\u014ddaiji temple in Nara. Highly accomplished priests were believed to be living deities. After such a priest died, portrait sculptures were created and placed in special worship halls where monks made ritual offerings and performed daily religious devotions.","title":"Portrait Sculpture of Priest Gy\u014dki","marks":null},"4946":{"folder":4,"accession_number":"96.1.1","art_champions_text":null,"artist":"Artist: Jean-Joseph Chapuis","catalogue_raissonne":null,"classification":" Furniture","continent":"Europe","country":"Belgium","creditline":"The William Hood Dunwoody Fund","culture":null,"curator_approved":0.0,"dated":"c. 1805","department":"Decorative Arts, Textiles and Sculpture","description":"Pair of armchairs in the Etruscan style","dimension":"35 1\/2 x 22 x 21 1\/2 in.

The white disk is ground from the shell of the Tridacna, a large sea clam, which was also used for money. The brown inner disk was carved from boiled tortoiseshell and attached to the other half of the ornament by a beaded string. The addition of beads further increased its value and prestige.

The low entranceway required all participants to humble themselves as they entered the tearoom from the garden. Although a built-in alcove for the display of art was adopted from more formal structures, its size was greatly reduced--sufficient only to display a small painting or simple floral arrangement. \r\n\r\nThe museum's teahouse is based on the Sa-an, an 18th century teahouse within the Zen monastery of Daitokuji in Kyoto that is now designated as one of Japan's \"Important Cultural Properties.\" A small, carved signboard under the eaves of the museum's teahouse reads  \"Zenshin-an,\" Hermitage of the Meditative Heart -- a name bestowed on the structure by Fukushima Keid\u014d, the current abbot of Tofukuji temple in Kyoto.","title":"Replica of the Saan Teahouse at Daitokuji Gyokurin-in, Kyoto","marks":null},"59842":{"folder":59,"accession_number":"2002.2.3","art_champions_text":null,"artist":"Artist: Lan Ying","catalogue_raissonne":null,"classification":" Paintings","continent":"Asia","country":"China","creditline":"Gift of Ruth and Bruce Dayton","culture":null,"curator_approved":0.0,"dated":"c. 1640","department":"Chinese, South and Southeast Asian Art","description":"2 figures in boat, LRC; trees on a river with buildings and faint mountains in distance; inscription and seals in ULC; another figure in a boat at L","dimension":"120 x 55 in.

However, until very recently its significance and its location at the MIA were completely overlooked. The picture demonstrates the importance that Rousseau ascribed to panoramic mountain views. The subject's iconographic interest resided also in the fact that ownership of the Savoy region reverted to France, after fifty years, only in 1861 (two years before Rousseau's second Alpine visit) when a treaty signed by France and Italy established the boundary between those countries as passing directly through the summit of Mont Blanc. In addition to this topical iconographic interest, the painting's remarkable light effects and its complex proto-pointillist facture, which confused most critics at the time, evidence an experimental technique that was both unorthodox and prescient.\r\n\r\nConservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Douglas and Mary Olson and Al and Dena Naylor through the Art Champions program.

Like most fashionable houses erected in Charleston in the 18th century, the Stuart house was one room wide and flanked by a balcony - a spatial arrangement that allowed cooling ocean breezes to flow through the interior. This room was originally on the second floor and remains virtually intact. The closed door at the far end of the room initially led to the balcony, and there were windows where two passageways now connect this room with the Charleston Dining Room.\r\n\t\r\nThis room, the largest in the house, was probably used for dinner parties, dances, and other entertainments. It was originally equipped with costly new furniture made in Charleston and other seaports along the East Coast, such as Boston, Newport, and Philadelphia. The furniture was in the rococo or Chippendale style, named for the English cabinetmaker and designer Thomas Chippendale, and is noted for its sinuous lines and beautifully carved organic ornament. The outstanding quality of the rococo carving over the fireplace and the precise classical proportions of the woodwork were probably executed by the English-trained craftsman Ezra Waite, who was responsible for numerous other pre-revolutionary Charleston interiors.\r\n\t\r\nThe present arrangement of the room is similar to that of its 1931 installation, when the great silver collectors, James Ford Bell and his wife, Louise Heffelfinger, presented it to the museum. The furniture and decoration of the room reflect the 18th-century taste for fine objects made along the East Coast and England as well as items imported from China. In the 18th century, seating furniture lined the walls when not in use and the floors were left bare.","title":"Charleston Drawing Room","marks":null},"8031":{"folder":8,"accession_number":"84.85a-c","art_champions_text":null,"artist":null,"catalogue_raissonne":null,"classification":" Ceramics","continent":"Europe","country":"France","creditline":"Gift of funds from Mrs. Christian Aall in memory of her grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. M.

The Jonathan Rose house met the same fate, although two paneled rooms from that 18th-century house are installed at the Yale University Art Gallery. Like the interiors of the Rose house, the paneled fireplace wall here probably came from a first-floor room in a house with a massive central fireplace and wraparound staircase. Comparable mid-18th-century framed houses, sheathed in clapboarding, can be seen today throughout New England.\r\n\t\r\nIn 1929, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts installed the fireplace wall; by the addition of three white stucco walls, it is now interpreted as a parlor and bedroom in memory of Josephine Koon.

This unusual construction technique is not employed anywhere else in the Pacific Islands.  Ritual designs and physical details were then painted on the exterior of the mask in a variety of natural pigments.
