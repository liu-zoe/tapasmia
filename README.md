## __Project Description__
There is something different about enjoying an artwork with the audio guide than just looking at the text on the sign next to it. Often times, when I was at MIA, I found myself distracted by reading the text instead of spending time enjoying the art. So this little project is intended to be a stay-at-home audio guide for myself to look at the object while listening to the audio stops.

### **How to Use**
Refresh the webpage to get a random artwork and listen to the audio stop.

### **Data Source**
Data in this project were extracted from the [**Mia collection**](https://github.com/artsmia/collection) Github repo in 2021 March. There were 94000+ objects listed at the time, and over six hundred of them had audio stops. This project used those 600+ objects with audio files.
